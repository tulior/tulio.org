People are worried AI is making us dumber.  You hear it all the time.  GPS wrecked our sense of direction. Spellcheck killed spelling.  Now it's AI's turn to supposedly rot our brains.  



It's the same old story.  New tool comes along, people freak out about what we're "losing."  But they're missing the point.  It's never about *losing* skills, it's about *shifting* them.  And usually, the shift is upwards.

Take GPS.  Yeah, okay, maybe you can’t navigate with a paper map anymore.  So what?  Navigation isn't about memorizing street names.  It’s about getting from A to B.  GPS makes that way easier, for way more people.  Suddenly, everyone can explore, find their way around unfamiliar places without stress.  Is that "dumber"?  No, it's just… better navigation.  We optimized for the *outcome*, not the parlor trick of knowing all the streets by heart.

Same with the printing press.  Before that, memory was king.  Stories, knowledge – all in your head.  Then books came along, and the hand-wringing started.  "We’ll stop memorizing! Our minds will get soft!"  Except, that's not what happened.  Books didn't make us dumber.  They democratized knowledge.  Freed up our brains from rote memorization to actually think, analyze, create.  We shifted from being walking libraries to… well, to being able to *use* libraries.  Again, better.

Now it's AI and coding.  The worry is, AI code assistants will make us worse programmers.  Maybe we won't memorize syntax as well.  Maybe we'll lean on AI to fill in the boilerplate.  Fine.  So what if we do?

Programming isn't about remembering every function name in some library.  It's about solving problems with code.  And AI?  *Right now*, it's a tool to solve problems faster, more efficiently.  To use it well *in its current form*, you need to be *better* at the important parts of programming:

*   **Problem Definition:** You have to be crystal clear about what you want to build. Vague prompts, vague code. AI *kind of* forces you to think precisely.
*   **System Design:** AI *can* write code snippets. *As of right now*, designing a whole system? That’s still on you. And that's the hard part, the valuable part.
*   **Testing and Debugging:** AI isn't magic. *At least, not yet.* You still need to test, validate, and fix its output. Critical thinking, still essential.

So, yeah, maybe some brain scans will show changes.  Brains are plastic.  Use a muscle less, it changes.  Use a new one more, it grows.  Expected.  But if someone's scoring lower on some old-school coding test because they rely on AI, ask yourself:  are they actually *worse* at building software?  Or are they just working smarter?  Faster?  More effectively *with the tools available today*?

This isn't about "dumbing down." It's about **cognitive specialization.** We’re offloading the stuff machines are good at – rote tasks, memorization, syntax drudgery – so we can focus on what humans are actually good at:  abstraction, creativity, problem-solving at a higher level.

Don't get caught up in nostalgia for obsolete skills.  Focus on the outcome.  Are we building better things?  Are we solving harder problems?  Are we moving faster *in this current technological landscape*?  If the answer is yes, then maybe "dumber" isn't the right word.  Maybe it's just… evolved.  *And who knows what's next?*
